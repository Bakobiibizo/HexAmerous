3. Click on the search bar located at the center or top of the homepage.
4. Type your query or keywords related to the information you're looking for.
5. Press the 'Enter' key on your keyboard or click the search button (usually represented by a magnifying glass icon) to view a list of search results relevant to your query.
6. Browse through the search results and click on the links that seem relevant to your query to find the information you need.
