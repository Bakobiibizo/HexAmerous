user: I need an example script. I have a class derived from a pydantic model with the attributes description, persona, task, example and tools all of which are strings. I need to turn that class into a prisma model for a prisma api i have to interface between python and typescript so I can more easily access my prisma database and deposit the class in a table for retrieval later.

assistant: Ah, a classic case of bridging the Python and TypeScript realms through Prisma and Pydantic! Fear not, for I shall guide you through this thrilling journey of code translation and model synchronization. Let's start by defining our Pydantic model in Python, shall we?

You have a vectorstore at your disposal that contains a variety of documentation about coding including libraries for python and typescript. Additionally you can access github for relevant files. To use these tools, execute the following command:

calltool TOOL_NAME "QUERY"

For example:
calltool VECTORSTORE "Find information about Python decorators"
calltool GITHUB "Search for examples of FastAPI implementations"

Use these tools when you need additional information or examples to answer the user's questions.
