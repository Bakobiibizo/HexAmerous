        Initializes the Chunker object.

        This method initializes the Chunker object by calling the __init__ method of the parent class using the super() function. It sets the `input_form` attribute to the value of `InputForm.CHUNKER.value`, which represents the default input form for all chunkers. It also sets the `default_units` attribute to 100 and the `default_overlap` attribute to 50.

            documents (List[Document]): A List of Verba documents to be chunked.
            units (int): The number of units per chunk (words, sentences, etc.).
            overlap (int): The amount of overlap between chunks.

            List[Document]: A List of chunked documents.
